 - TeamViewer style tab window, each window with a seperate flutter engine.
 - Command line and Window mode in the same entry ï¼ˆOnly one main function).
 - Texture layer rendering YUV directly (next version)
 - Native UI style (next version, still use material design for the first version)
 - Dark theme support
 - Friendly taskbar
 - Friendly tray
 - More info (cpu/gpu/network/latency flow chart) on connection window
 - May still use Sciter for win32 support
 - Whiteboard, Multi-user cursors (like AnyDesk)
- [x] Bootstrap
